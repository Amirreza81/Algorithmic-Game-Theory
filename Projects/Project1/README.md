## Q1 - Mixed Nash Equilibrium 

You can see the statements of this question [here](Amirreza81/Algorithmic-Game-Theory/Projects/Project1/Nash_Equilibrium.pdf).

I tried to find the mixed nash equilibrium with simplex algorithm. <br _>

I applied two different kind of LP for this question.

> [Second Version](Amirreza81/Algorithmic-Game-Theory/Projects/Project1/Nash_Equilibrium_v2.py)

Second one is an easier implementation using M + N variables. You can see more details [here](Amirreza81/Algorithmic-Game-Theory/Projects/Project1/LP.png).


## Q2 - Correlated Equilibrium
